# ActAgain
Babby's first react project

## Notes
- Uses the Yahoo Weather API, which seems to be buggy at times.
For instance, the visibility and pressure values seem to be odd.


## TODOs
- customized icons for each condition
- fade in components
- refactor code - block sections as components
- documentation
